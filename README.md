# Miniature Skirmish Game

## Main Goals

- **Miniature-Centric Gameplay**
  - **Card Design**: Each miniature's card will feature all its rules and stats on one side to promote focus on the miniature and encourage diverse strategic options. The opposite side will display an image of the miniature, supporting both proxying and easy identification.
  - **Game Mechanics**: All game mechanics are directly tied to individual miniatures, with no overarching army rules or general tactics. This ensures that all gameplay elements are visually represented on the battlefield, enhancing the thematic immersion and strategic depth of the game.

- Alternating activations
  - Keeps the players engaged and reduces downtime

## Core Rules

### Turn Sequence and Activation Order

1. **Roll to Determine Starting Player**:
   - At the beginning of the game, players roll dice to determine who will activate first.

2. **Alternate Activations**:
   - Players take turns activating their miniatures one at a time.

3. **Switch Starting Player Each Turn**:
   - The player who did not activate the last miniature in the previous turn starts the next turn.
     - This ensures no player gets consecutive activations between turns.

### Actions

- **Action Limit**: Each miniature has an action limit, which indicates the maximum number of actions it can perform during its activation. This limit reflects the miniatureâ€™s speed and agility.
- **Performing Actions**: During its activation, a miniature can perform any combination of the actions listed below, without repeating any single action, up to its action limit.
  - **Move**: The miniature can move up to its movement range in inches.
  - **Attack**: The miniature can make an attack if a target is within the weapon's maximum range.
  - **Charge**: The miniature can move double its movement range in inches if the move ends within one inch of an enemy miniature.
  
### Weapons

- Weapons have standardized stats for range, number of attacks, and damage:
  - **Range**: Defined as range of minimum and maximum distance in inches.
    - For example, a "melee" weapon has a range of 0-1 inches and a "ranged" weapon has a range of 1-12 inches.
  - **Attacks**: Each weapon allows a specific number of attack dice.
  - **Damage**: Each successful attack deals a set damage value.
- **Combat Sequence**:
  1. **Hit Roll**: The attacking miniature rolls dice based on the weapon's number of attacks, needing to meet or exceed its own skill stat to hit.
  2. **Defense Roll**: For each hit, the defending miniature rolls to negate the attack, needing to meet or exceed its defense stat.
  3. **Damage Application**: Unblocked hits deal their damage value to the defending miniature. Targets are removed if their health reaches 0 or less.

## FAQ

**Q: Isn't the rule limiting all rules and stats to one side of a miniature's card too restrictive?**

A: It's a design choice to keep the focus on the miniatures themselves, instead of relying on "invisible" rules or abilities that aren't represented by the figures. This way, players can easily see what each miniature can do at a glance, and it encourages strategic variety based on the miniatures' unique stats and abilities.
