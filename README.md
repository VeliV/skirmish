# Miniature Skirmish Game

## Main Goals

- **Miniature-Centric Gameplay**
  - **Miniature Agnostic**: This game is designed to be played with any miniatures. Got a board game with cool minis gathering dust? Create cards for them and bring them to life this way! Got a bunch of minis from different games? Mix and match them to create unique warbands! Want to play with pebbles and sticks? Go for it! The only rule is that you and your opponent must be able to tell which miniature corresponds to which card.
  - **Card Design**: Each miniature's card displays its rules and stats on one side for easy reference. The opposite side should include an image of the miniature or another identifier to ensure players can clearly distinguish each piece during play. Whether using traditional miniatures or alternative items, a quick photo with your phone is sufficient to meet this requirement.
  - **Game Mechanics**: All game mechanics are directly tied to individual miniatures, with no overarching army rules or stratagems. This ensures that all gameplay elements are visually represented on the battlefield, enhancing the thematic immersion and strategic depth of the game.
  - **Alternating activations**: Keeps the players engaged and reduces downtime. It also reduces analysis paralysis, as players have to make decisions more frequently.

## Core Rules

### Dice used

- **D6**: Six-sided dice are used for all rolls in the game.
  - An unmodified roll of 6 is always a success, while a roll of 1 is always a failure.

### Turn Sequence and Activation Order

1. **Roll to Determine Starting Player**:
   - At the beginning of the game, players roll dice to determine who will activate first.

2. **Alternate Activations**:
   - Players take turns activating their miniatures one at a time.

3. **Switch Starting Player at the End of Each Turn:**:
   - The player who did not activate the last miniature in the previous turn starts the next turn.
     - This rule prevents any player from activating miniatures consecutively across turns, ensuring fair and balanced play by alternating the strategic advantage of the first move.

### Actions

- **Action Limit**: Each miniature has an action limit, which indicates the maximum number of actions it can perform during its activation. This limit reflects the miniatureâ€™s speed and agility.
- **Performing Actions**: During its activation, a miniature can perform any combination of the actions listed below, without repeating any single action, up to its action limit.
  - **Basic actions**
    - **Move**: The miniature can move up to its movement range in inches.
    - **Attack**: The miniature can make an attack if a target is within the weapon's maximum range and in line of sight.
  - **Abilities**
    - Abilities are miniature specific actions that are listed on the miniature's card. For example, a miniature might have a "Charge" ability that allows it to move and attack in the same activation.
  
### Weapons

- Weapons have standardized stats for range, number of attacks, and damage:
  - **Range**: Defined as range of minimum and maximum distance in inches.
    - For example, a "melee" weapon has a range of 0-1 inches and a "ranged" weapon has a range of 1-12 inches.
  - **Attacks**: Each weapon allows a specific number of attack dice.
  - **Damage**: Each successful attack deals a set damage value.
- **Combat Sequence**:
  1. **Hit Roll**: The attacking miniature rolls dice based on the weapon's number of attacks, needing to meet or exceed its own skill stat to hit.
  2. **Defense Roll**: For each hit, the defending miniature rolls to negate the attack, needing to meet or exceed its defense stat.
  3. **Damage Application**: Unblocked hits deal their damage value to the defending miniature. Targets are removed if their health reaches 0 or less.

## FAQ

**Q: Isn't the rule limiting all rules and stats to one side of a miniature's card too restrictive?**

A: It's a design choice to keep the focus on the miniatures themselves, instead of relying on "invisible" rules or abilities that aren't represented by the figures. This way, players can easily see what each miniature can do at a glance, and it encourages strategic variety based on the miniatures' unique stats and abilities.
