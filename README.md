# Miniature Skirmish Game

## Main Goals

- Focus on the miniatures
  - All rules and stats for each miniature must fit on one side of its card, encouraging strategic variety across different miniatures and focusing on the figures themselves.
    - On the flip side of the card, there has to be a picture of the miniature
      - Should enable proxying, while making sure that the miniature is easily identifiable
  - All mechanics are based on the miniatures
    - No army wide rules, special tactics or stratagems that are not represented by the miniatures
  
- Alternating activations
  - Each miniature has a speed tier
  - Activations start from the highest speed and go down
  - Players alternate activating miniatures within the same speed tier
  - Once all miniatures of a speed tier have activated, player move to the next speed tier
  - If player has no miniatures left to activate in a speed tier, their opponent activates all of their miniatures in that speed tier
    - The player who had less miniatures activate in that speed tier gets to activate the first miniature in the next speed tier

## Core Rules

### Turn Sequence

- **Start of Turn**: Players roll dice to decide who activates first.
  - In case of a tie, reroll until a winner is determined.

### Actions

- Once per activation, a miniature can perform following actions up to its action limit
- You can only perform each action once per activation
  - Move
    - Miniature can move up to it's movement range in inches
  - Attack with a weapon
    - Each weapon has a maximum range in inches
    - If the target is within the maximum range, the attack can be made
  - Charge
    - Miniature can move double it's movement range in inches
  
### Weapons

- Weapons have standardized stats for range, number of attacks, and damage:
  - **Range**: Defined as range of minimum and maximum distance in inches.
    - For example, a "melee" weapon has a range of 0-1 inches and a "ranged" weapon has a range of 1-12 inches.
  - **Attacks**: Each weapon allows a specific number of attack dice.
  - **Damage**: Each successful attack deals a set damage value.
- **Combat Sequence**:
  1. **Hit Roll**: The attacking miniature rolls dice based on the weapon's number of attacks, needing to meet or exceed its own skill stat to hit.
  2. **Defense Roll**: For each hit, the defending miniature rolls to negate the attack, needing to meet or exceed its defense stat.
  3. **Damage Application**: Unblocked hits deal their damage value to the defending miniature. Targets are removed if their health reaches 0 or less.

## FAQ

**Q: Isn't the rule limiting all rules and stats to one side of a miniature's card too restrictive?**

**A:** If you have no miniatures left in a speed tier, your opponent will activate all their remaining miniatures in that tier. This can be countered by building a list with more variety in speed tiers. This rule is deliberate, balanced by making faster units more expensive. It underscores the strategic decision to invest in speed at a higher cost.

**Q: What happens if I run out of miniatures to activate within a specific speed tier?**

**A:** If you have no miniatures left in a speed tier, your opponent activates all their remaining miniatures in that speed tier. This is intentional and should is countered by the increased point cost of faster units. This mechanic reflects the strategic trade-off of investing in faster, albeit more costly, units.
