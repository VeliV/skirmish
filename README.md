# Miniature Skirmish Game

## Main Goals

- **Miniature-Centric**: This game is designed to be played with any miniatures. Got a board game with cool minis gathering dust? Create cards for them and bring them to life this way! Got a bunch of minis from different games? Mix and match them to create unique warbands! Want to play with pebbles and sticks? Go for it! The only rule is that you and your opponent must be able to tell which miniature corresponds to which card.
- **Card Design**: Each miniature's card displays its rules and stats on one side for easy reference. The opposite side should include an image of the miniature or another identifier to ensure players can clearly distinguish each piece during play. Whether using traditional miniatures or alternative items, a quick photo with your phone is sufficient to meet this requirement.
- **Game Mechanics**: All game mechanics are directly tied to individual miniatures, with no overarching army rules or stratagems. This ensures that all gameplay elements are visually represented on the battlefield, enhancing the thematic immersion and strategic depth of the game.
- **Alternating activations**: Keeps the players engaged and reduces downtime. It also reduces analysis paralysis, as players have to make decisions more frequently.

## Core Rules

### Dice used

- **D6**: Six-sided dice are used for all rolls in the game.
  - An unmodified roll of 6 is always a success, while a roll of 1 is always a failure.

### Turn Sequence and Activation Order

1. **Roll to Determine Starting Player**:
   - At the beginning of the game, players roll dice to determine who will start the first turn.

2. **Alternate Activations**:
   - Players alternate activating their miniatures one at a time during a turn.
   - If one player runs out of miniatures to activate, the other player continues to activate their remaining miniatures until all have been activated.
   - The turn concludes when all miniatures on both sides have been activated.

3. **Switch Starting Player at the End of Each Turn:**:
   - The player who did not activate the last miniature in the previous turn starts the next turn.
     - This rule is essential when the number of miniatures per player is unequal, ensuring no player can activate twice consecutively across turns.

### Actions

- **Action Limit**: Each miniature has an action limit, which indicates the maximum number of actions it can perform during its activation. This limit reflects the miniatureâ€™s speed and agility.
- **Performing Actions**: During its activation, a miniature can perform any combination of the actions listed below, without repeating any single action, up to its action limit.
  - **Basic actions**
    - **Move**: The miniature can move up to its movement range in inches.
    - **Attack**: The miniature can make an attack if a target is within the weapon's maximum range and in line of sight.
  - **Abilities**
    - Abilities are miniature specific actions that are listed on the miniature's card. For example, a miniature might have a "Charge" ability that allows it to move and attack in the same activation.
  
### Weapons

- Weapons have standardized stats for range, number of attacks, and damage:
  - **Range**: Defined as range of minimum and maximum distance in inches.
    - For example, a "melee" weapon has a range of 0-1 inches and a "ranged" weapon has a range of 1-12 inches.
  - **Attacks**: Each weapon allows a specific number of attack dice.
  - **Damage**: Each successful attack deals a set damage value.
- **Combat Sequence**:
  1. **Hit Roll**: The attacking miniature rolls dice based on the weapon's number of attacks, needing to meet or exceed its own skill stat to hit.
  2. **Defense Roll**: For each hit, the defending miniature rolls to negate the attack, needing to meet or exceed its defense stat.
  3. **Damage Application**: Unblocked hits deal their damage value to the defending miniature. Targets are removed if their health reaches 0 or less.

## Miniature Cards

- **Movement Range**: Distance the miniature can move in inches.
- **Skill Stat**: The value needed on a D6 roll to successfully hit with an attack.
- **Defense Stat**: The value needed on a D6 roll to successfully defend against an attack.
- **Health**: The amount of damage a miniature can sustain before being removed from play.
- **Action Limit**: The maximum number of actions a miniature can perform during its activation.
- **Abilities**: Special actions unique to the miniature.
- **Weapons**: List of weapons the miniature can use, containing range, number of attacks, and damage.

## Balancing

- **Everything comes at a cost**: All stats, abilities and weapons have a point cost. Sum it all up to get the total cost of the miniature.
  - No need to do the math, just select what you want for the miniature in the app and it will calculate the total cost for you.
  - To play a balanced game, both players should have equal or similar point totals for their warbands.
    - Note that the number of miniatures can be different, but the total point cost should be similar.
- **Versioned balance**: The point cost formula will be updated as needed to ensure balance.
  - When playing, make sure both players are using the same version of the point cost formula.
  - Abilities are the toughest to balance, so their point cost will be tied to specific versions.
- **Playtesting**: Spreadsheets and calculators can only do so much. Playtesting is essential to ensure that the game is balanced and fun.
  - Feel free to share your battle reports, feedback and pull requests to help improve the balance.

## FAQ

**Q: Isn't the rule limiting all rules and stats to one side of a miniature's card too restrictive?**

A: It's a design choice to keep the focus on the miniatures themselves, instead of relying on "invisible" rules or abilities that aren't represented by the figures. This way, players can easily see what each miniature can do at a glance, and it encourages strategic variety based on the miniatures' unique stats and abilities.

**Q: Is this game designed to replace existing miniature wargames?**

A: Not really. There's some great games out there with deep lore, rich settings, and complex rules. These games are the reason why we have so many cool miniatures to play with. Unfortunately, with every new edition, some of these games drift further away from the "miniature" part of the miniature wargame, opting instead to sell you more books and cards, which get outdated in less than a year.

This game, on the other hand, is designed to leverage the miniatures you've already invested both time and money in. On top of that, it's designed to be easy to learn, quick to play, and most importantly, fun.

**Q: Is this game suitable for competitive play?**

A: First and foremost, this game is designed to be fun. However, if you and your opponent find that fun in competitive play, then by all means, go for it!

**Q: What's the purpose of switching the starting player at the end of each turn?**

A: This is to prevent a player with more miniatures from activating in a row across turns. In such situation, one player could potentially activate the same mini twice in a row. This rule adds some balance, by giving the player with less miniatures the chance to activate first in turn.
